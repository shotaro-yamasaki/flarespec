A Table Model for XSPEC: Modified Black Body with Resonant Cyclotron Scattering

This model incorporates modified Planckian emission in the presence of strong magnetic fields [(Lyubarsky 2002)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/332/1/199/974516?login=true), as well as the effects of resonant cyclotron scattering [(Yamasaki et al. 2020)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/498/1/484/5885352?login=true).

The model has two parameters: the effective temperature in keV, and the normalization.
